%Thresholding is a Pixel based Image Segmentation technique. 
%graythresh(I) computes a global threshold T from grayscale image I, using Otsu's method. Otsu's method chooses a threshold that minimizes the intraclass variance of the thresholded black and white pixels. The global threshold T can be used with imbinarize to convert a grayscale image to a binary image.
I = imread("3.jpg");
I = rgb2gray(I);
I = imadjust(I);
level = graythresh(I)
J = imbinarize(I,level);
imshow(J); figure;
